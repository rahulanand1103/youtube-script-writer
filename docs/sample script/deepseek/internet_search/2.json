            "content": "This is a nice trick: it helps you measure e.g. MMLU and MMBench accuracy in the pretraining checkpoints to see if the capabilities are improving over time, which gives you more resolution to whether the model is getting better at X but worse at Y31. This is not terribly necessary in a model with one objective, but in a multimodal model it becomes more important. The benchmarks are pretty strong here, which should by now be a pretty typical story for a DeepSeek model \u2013 at the frontier of open source, just shy of the closed models.",
