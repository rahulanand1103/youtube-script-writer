By carefully tuning learning rates, batch sizes, and other hyperparameters 2, DeepSeek-LLM demonstrates that stable large-scale training is achievable, but it requires meticulous design of the architecture of the transformer model together with the infrastructure of the High Performance Computing (HPC) data center used to train it.",
